#a name given to a partition through programming is called a variable ie a named memory space in the comp hard disk
num1 = 65
num2 = 100 #instruction written to a comp ie to find any next available memory and name it num2 and reserve it then store there 100
print(num1)
print(num1, num2)
# RULES GOVERNING VARIABLE NAMES IN PYTHON
#the name of a variable should never start with a numeral or numeric value eg 1num, 2num or special characters like .,@#? etc
#compound variable names should not have spaces rather with _ or camel case or camel notation
#avoid using capital letters to start your variable names
#don't use special words as variables ig print, input etc
#Variables in Python are case sensitive ie Num1 is not the same as num1
