#a name given to a partition through programming is called a variable ie a named memory space in the comp hard disk
num1 = 65
num2 = 100 #instruction written to a comp ie to find any next available memory and name it num2 and reserve it then store there 100
print(num1)
print(num1, num2)
# RULES GOVERNING VARIABLE NAMES IN PYTHON
#the name of a variable should never start with a numeral or numeric value eg 1num, 2num or special characters like .,@#? etc
#compound variable names should not have spaces rather with _ or camel case or camel notation
#avoid using capital letters to start your variable names
#don't use special words as variables ig print, input etc
#Variables in Python are case sensitive ie Num1 is not the same as num1
#A complete instruction to a computer is called a statement i.e line 2-5
#A statement that evaluates to a result is called an expression e.g line 5 we get a result of addittion
#A Python File is called python script
#A Group of statements is called a code
#A group of related code is called a block of code
#A block of code or just a group of code or just code in a python script is called a program therefore a program 
#Running or Implementing a Program is called execution
#The process of creating a variable to a memory location is called declaring a variable
#The process of giving/storing a value in a variable is called initializing or assigning
#In Python you cannot create a variable and not assign it a value. ALL VARIABLES(MEMORY) MUST HAVE A VALUE
#Semantics is what you have written in python or the statement(the set of rules that define how Python code is executed and interpreted) while syntax is what you write or the language to communicate with python.
#you declare a variable
