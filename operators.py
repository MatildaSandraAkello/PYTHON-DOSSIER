# OPERATORS IN PYTHON
# An Operator is a character or a special symbol that tells a computer what to do with an operand(value).

num = 100 # The equal sign is an operator and tells CPU to do something with the value 100. 
#100 in this case is our operand whlist the operator is =

#TYPES OF OPERATORS IN PYTHON
# 1. Arithmetic Operators e.g (+, -, /, *, % modulo ie remainder after division, // called floor division and rounds up to nearest smaller whole number e.g 3.5 will be 3, ** raised to the power)
# 2. Logical Operators e.g (and(TRUE is both operands are TRUE), or(if atleast one operand is TRUE), not(If the operand is FALSE))
# 3. Bitwise Operators (&- Bitwise AND, |- Bitwise OR, - Bitwise NOT, ^ - Bitwise XOR, >> Bitwise right shift, << Bitwise left shift)
# 4. Membership Operators (in - True if value/variable is 'FOUND' in sequence, not in - True if value/variable is 'NOT FOUND' in sequence)
# 5. Assignment Operators e.g (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=)
# 6. Comparison Operators e.g (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)
# 7. Identity Operators (is - True if operands are 'identical', is not - True if operands are 'not identical')
